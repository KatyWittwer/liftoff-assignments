# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview
My project will be a web application that will allow users to track board meeting attendance; create an individual login; view the user who entered the meeting records; run a variety of reports on attendance rates; view year-to-date board attendance percentages displayed at the top of the page.  

This idea came from a non-profit board retreat during which it was determined that attendance needed to be tracked in a more efficient and transparent manner. Currently it’s tracked only on paper and manually calculated throughout the year so this application will increase efficiency. The organization’s goal is to achieve 75% or higher and currently board officers do not have ongoing access to real-time performance information.  Having the information on hand will allow for heightened visibility when attendance falls below 75%, with the intention of improving attendance levels.

## Features
1. User signup/login 
1. Create meeting - Main page will have an HTML form to create meeting and enter meeting attendance information
